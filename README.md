<h1>📈 Bitcoin Price Prediction Project📉</h1>

A comprehensive graduation project featuring a Python-based Machine Learning backend and a native Android application for visualizing Bitcoin predictions.

✨ Overview

This project is designed to forecast Bitcoin prices using various machine learning models and present the results in a clean, interactive mobile interface. It's a full-stack solution combining data science with mobile development.

The system is composed of two main components:

🤖 Python Backend (graduationBackend):

Performs price predictions using Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.

Serves these predictions through a robust REST API built with Flask.

📱 Android Application (graduationAndroid):

Natively developed in Kotlin, following modern Android practices.

Fetches prediction data from the backend service.

Visualizes complex data into user-friendly and interactive charts.

🚀 Key Features

Feature	Description

Multi-Model Support	Utilizes 4 distinct ML models to provide a range of predictions.
